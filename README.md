# RenewableGridModel

**Octave/MATLAB-based simulation tool** for analyzing renewable energy systems, particularly photovoltaic (PV) and wind power generation, battery storage integration, and grid interaction dynamics.

This project provides a framework for system sizing, energy balancing, and feasibility assessment of renewable electricity supply using real-world capacity factor data and flexible system parameters.
