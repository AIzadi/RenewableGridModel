**Octave/MATLAB-based simulation tool** for analyzing renewable energy systems, particularly photovoltaic (PV) and wind power generation, battery storage integration, and grid interaction dynamics.

This project provides a framework for system sizing, energy balancing, and feasibility assessment of renewable electricity supply using real-world capacity factor data and flexible system parameters.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Hourly simulation of PV and wind generation using capacity factor datasets
- Battery storage modeling with charge/discharge logic
- Grid energy exchange (withdrawal/injection) based on demand balance
- Gamma optimization and Alpha–Beta exploration algorithms
- Excel and CSV-based I/O for input data and results
